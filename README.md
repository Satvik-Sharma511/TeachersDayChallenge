## 📖 About

I'm taking on a 43-day coding challenge leading up to *Teachers' Day* to improve consistency and problem-solving in Data Structures and Algorithms. Each day, I will solve *2 advanced-level DSA problems, primarily on **LeetCode, using **C++*.

This challenge is a small tribute to all the *teachers and mentors* who have shaped my journey in tech.
